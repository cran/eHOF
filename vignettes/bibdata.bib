	(R)) was developed in The Netherlands for the processing of phytosociological
	data. This package comprises an easy-to-use data base management
	system. The data bank to be managed can be divided into several data
	bases which may consist of up to 100 000 releves each. The program
	provides methods for input. import, selection, and export of releves.
	In 1994, TURBOVEG was accepted as the standard computer package for
	the European Vegetation Survey. Currently it has been installed in
	more than 25 countries throughout Europe and overseas.},

  journal = {Journal of Vegetation Science},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {37--46},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Variation in the abundance of species in space and/or time can be
	caused by a wide range of underlying processes. Before such causes
	can be analysed we need simple mathematical models which can describe
	the observed response patterns. For this purpose a hierarchical set
	of models is presented. These models are applicable to positive data
	with an upper bound, like relative frequencies and percentages. The
	models are fitted to the observations by means of logistic and non-linear
	regression techniques. Working with models of increasing complexity
	allows us to choose for the simplest possible model which sufficiently
	explains the observed pattern. The models are particularly suited
	for description of responses in time or over major environmental
	gradients. Deviations from these temporal or spatial trends may be
	statistically ascribed to, for example, climatic fluctuations or
	small-scale spatial heterogeneity. The applicability of this approach
	is illustrated by examples from recent research. A combination of
	simple, descriptive models like those presented in this paper and
	causal models as developed by several others, is advocated as a powerful
	tool towards a fuller understanding of the dynamics and patterns
	of vegetational change.},
