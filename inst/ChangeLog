Version 1.15 (2024-01)
	* bug in Para (optimize parameterisation) regarding model V fixed
	* documentation cleaned

Version 1.12 (2022-04)
	* bug in Para regarding outer.niche for model III

Version 1.10 (2022-01)
	* solving a bug in Para without setting x=newdata, mostly regarding outer.niche

Version 1.9 (2020-05)
	* maintenance update
	* CRAN policies

Version 1.8 (2016-01)
	* Para failed sometimes for models without inflection points

Version 1.6 (2015-11)
	* Para failed for some model III responses
	* Bugfixes for Para_deriv and Para_opt

Version 1.5.9 (2015-05)
	* outer and inner niche limits set to gradient range for all models for consistency

Version 1.5.8 (2015-04)
	* Para_opt and plot.HOF: corrected for M != 1
	* CRAN policy maintenance

Version 1.5.4 (Oct 11 2014)
	* pick.model: it was possible to select refused model V by bootstrapping
	* Para.HOF: improvements

Version 1.5.3 (Oct 11 2014)
	* HOF.default: bootselect mechanism secured against primarily rejected modeltypes

Version 1.5 (Sept 27 2014)
	* Para.HOF: Calculation of optima fixed
	* pick.model: Bootselect messages mechanism changed

Version 1.4 (April 22 2014)
	* HOF.default: missing test=test in pick.model subfunction prohibited other selection criteria than AICc during bootstrap

Version 1.3 (Dec 15 2013)
	* HOF.model: The backup procedure for optimization with function optim did not scaled the x gradient (to values between 0 and 1) and therefore gave wrong results

Version 1.2 (Nov 30 2013)
	* Para.HOF: Problems with calculation of optima and subsequent attributes in models VI and VII fixed
