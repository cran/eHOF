eHOF RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 1.5.7 (Jan 13 2015)
	* pick.model: the default is now to select most frequent bootstrap result only if it is a simpler model than the original choice (selectMethod = bootselectlower) 
	* Para.opt: restriction of optima to the gradient range in concordance to the other models
	* Para.deriv: slope for model has now the same length as the gradient and not only a single 0; model IV: missing inflection points if optimum is equal to a gradient border gave an error message

Version 1.5.4 (Oct 11 2014)
	* pick.model: it was possible to select refused model V by bootstrapping
	* Para.HOF: improvements

Version 1.5.3 (Oct 11 2014)
	* HOF.default: bootselect mechanism secured against primarily rejected modeltypes

Version 1.5 (Sept 27 2014)
	* Para.HOF: Calculation of optima fixed
	* pick.model: Bootselect messages mechanism changed

Version 1.4 (April 22 2014)
	* HOF.default: missing test=test in pick.model subfunction prohibited other selection criteria than AICc during bootstrap

Version 1.3 (Dec 15 2013)
	* HOF.model: The backup procedure for optimization with function optim did not scaled the x gradient (to values between 0 and 1) and therefore gave wrong results

Version 1.2 (Nov 30 2013)
	* Para.HOF: Problems with calculation of optima and subsequent attributes in models VI and VII fixed
